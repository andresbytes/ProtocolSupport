# ProtocolSupport

A plugin to support multiple protocols for PocketMine-MP.

### Supported protocols

- 407 (1.6.0, 1.6.1)
- 408 (1.6.20)
- 410 (beta 1.6.100)

### Known issues

If any of your plugins changes the player class, unless it is specifically designed to work with this plugin, unexpected behaviour could occur.

In those cases, I don't take any responsibility nor will try to fix your problem, I recommend using reviewed plugins from [poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io). Most of them should work fine with ProtocolSupport. 

### Contributing
